# Jaccard_distance_cancer
Calcualtes the difference in mutations between primaries and metastasis from the same patient.This code uses Jaccard similarity to calculate the distance between the two and then clusters the output. 

 d_J(A,B) = 1 - J(A,B) = { { |A \cup B| - |A \cap B| } \over |A \cup B| }.
